On the Cody front, a brutal loss with a 3/18 botlane to cap off a 5-game loss steak. cody is now in SINGLE digit LP in the bottom of Emerald 4. Will he hit platinum before diamond? What is going on in this guy's head? (prob Lenny or King Henry).\n On the Michael front after completely running in his first game of the night, he picked it up to win his NEXT 5 games putting him back in Emerald 2. A new pocket pick formed in his Mordekaiser, when his Garens gets picked/banned or when his team needs an AP treat. With this new weapon in his arsenal, Michael will have increased confidence for his climb to the diamond. \nWill Cody plummet to the slums of Plat or finally hit Emerald 3? Will Micheal finally hit the coveted Emerald 1, find out tonight! I'm reminding everyone that the grand prize is $500, pride, and bragging rights.

Micheal is currently on fire, with a magical SEVEN GAME WIN STREAK, his Garen destroying everything he touches a testament to Michael's skill (lol) or the power of Garen.\n \nHowever, on Cody's end the complete opposite performance. Cody, is currently on a SEVEN GAME LOSE STREAK. On 0 LP in the bottom of Emerald 4 ( IT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE). One must wonder if he's doing this intentionally?  However, the challenge is not over yet! \nKEEP ON PUSHING! PRESSURE ON COAL MAKES DIAMONDS HOWEVER TOO MUCH PRESSURE WILL CAUSE COAL TO CRACK AND MAKE PLAT -King Henry", "Workin on it Lenore", "Day 3 of the Rift Report: A highly emotional day for both summoners, emotions, and tensions are high on both fronts as both parties have struggled to achieve their objectives.\n\nOn the Micheal front, after an exhilarating 7 game-win streak; Emotions were high. After a quick wing break with the boys, Micheal won the next \u00be games topped off with an incredible Warwick performance; an excellent pivot to deal with Camille (a strong counter vs Garen). Micheal dominated with a strong double-double score line 10/3/12, frequently stating \u201cGive me Paw\u201d to the enemy laner. Micheal ended his evening sesson at 50lp in Emerald 1, with thoughts of confidence that he may achieve the coveted rank of Diamond very soon, perhaps even that night. \n\nHowever, no one could expect the despair that could have happened at the start of Micheal's night session; with defeat after defeat mostly at the hands of his teammates, Micheal starts to question his ability to climb. In the final game of the night, he had a Corki Jungle going 3/13 and a Twitch support going 6/13. Micheal's sanity is being questioned after that brutal loss. He ends the night back at Emerald 2 with all his progress made today nullified. Micheal soon learns that nothing is free in this world; even a single LP is hard-earned. Hopefully, Micheal will grow stronger after this night. THERE\u2019S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH!\n\nOn the Cody front, it has been peaceful, with not a single game being played after his 7th loss in a row. Rumors from anonymous sources that Cody gave up (King Henry). I never knew Cody to be a quitter, perhaps I was mistaken. However, that challenge is not over yet! With Michael\u2019s recent setback, there is still time for Cody to come back!\n#KEEPFIGHTING #ENOUGHPRESSUREONCOALWILLMAKEDIAMONDS\n\nWILL MICHEAL REACH DIAMOND OR BE IN A PERMANENT CIRCLE OF DESPAIR?

Both summoners seem to be in a permanent state of despair as no summoner can make any meaningful progress on there objectives.\n\nOn the Micheal front: In his last session micheal went \u215c in his games. Topped off when an Ace Warwick performance went 10/7/3, however, his 0/10 botlane caused him the eventual defeat. Yesterday's losses was a combination of his team and micheal, as micheal had several games where is considerably underperformed. Specifically his 6/9/6 Mordekaiser where his laner went 14/3/7. His 1/4/2 Garen game, where his laner went 6/0/3 a PERFECT score from op. gg. A 2/6/4 Garen game where his laner went 8/1/8. One must wonder what is causing his lackluster performance.\u00a0 \nHOWEVER, WONDER NO MORE! I bring a special expert witness to help discover the root cause of Micheals piss-poor performance. I introduce King Henry; King Henry has been a diamond top-laner for many seasons (and went to Cornell), and his knowledge will surely be an asset for micheal climb to diamond. This is what King Henry has to say about Michael's performance: \u201cNow King Henry tell me what you think is causing Michael's drastic performance\u201d.\u00a0 \u201csure Jeff now in my expert opinion I see Michael has a lot of problems he frankly doesn't know what he's doing most of the time. he does not know Lane matchups well,l does not know how to freeze Lane, does not know how to push his leads is aggressive, he is aggressive when supposed to be passive, and passively supposed to be aggressive. I frankly do not know how he's gotten so high up with this poor performance, I get a brain cancer seeing him play\u201d -King Henry", "Now on the Cody front, it's not much better; He has gone 4/4 in yesterday's performance Losing three straight to top off the evening. Cody again faces is the same problems as Michael some games his teammate's fault ,while others his own.\u00a0 his last three losses are all some fault of Cody's. A 1/6/8 where the enemy jungle went 16/6/12, 1/5/3 where his laner went 7/1/7(vs a Velkoz lool). Lastly, 8/6/2 where he had an early lead but blew it by only split-pushing the entire game and blaming his team.\u00a0\n\nI'll bring it over to our expert witness King Henry to explain Cody\u2019s shortcomings. Here is what King Henry has to say: Yeah Cody has a lot of problems, all he does is he's just brain-dead split pus, never uses his TP, never helps the team, and extremely selfish player. Then he flames his team when they lose a 4/5 is mindful. Top it off with this extremely lackluster performance, poor matchup knowledge, and overall lack of intelligence I'm surprised he's still in Emerald. - King Henry.\u00a0\n\nThank You, Henry but the brutal but honest expert opinion.\n\nMicheal ends the season in Emerald 2 57 LP and Cody Emerald 4 0 LP. Both players seem to be in an endless state of agony. However, that challenge is not over yet! When recent performances from both players it's anyone's game!\n#KEEPFIGHTING #ENOUGHPRESSUREONCOALWILLMAKEDIAMONDS\n\nWILL MICHEAL HIT EMERALD 1? WILL CODY HIT EMERALD 3?

Both summoners are taking a break from the grind of solo q and looking for greener pasters in life. However, there have been drastic updates regarding one of the players within the challenge.\n\nOn the Micheal front, he has played two ranked games going 1-1 in them with basically zero LP gain or loss. He ends Day 6 at Emerald 3 48LP. He spent the rest of his evening playing flex with the boys and causing mayhem there. \n\nThe Cody front: After hitting Emerald 4 0LP. He decided to pivot into his smurf for the challenge hoping for better results there. The irony is that his is performing worse on his smurf than his main! He lost his last 6 ranked games with an overall 40% WR (see image below). I want to remind everyone that since the Emerald rank update, all rank distributions have been shifted back to one division. That means the Silver now is Bronze prior to the Emerald update. That means Cody is losing IN BRONZE ELO! A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY. As a last-ditch effort, Cody decides to go on his main to climb. However, hell soon learns the cruel reality of life has he has hit PLATINUM. What a fall from grace.", "ALERT ALERT ALERT\nMy anonymous sources have told me that Cody has QUIT the challenge. He could not handle the constant pressure and losses. HOWEVER, A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES to face Micheal in the climb to diamond: OQI! Oqi is a seasoned diamond veteran and should bring a greater challenger than the shitter Cody. Oqi starts the challenge at Platimum 4 29LP. The race to the diamond is back on and now better than ever!\n#KEEPFIGHTING #ENOUGHPRESSUREONCOALWILLMAKEDIAMONDS", "micheal has played 10 games per day", "he has time", "omg", "bro wtf", "i need to
